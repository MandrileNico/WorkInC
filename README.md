The works one, two and three, They are developments based on the klm46z development platform. Work one is simpler, I just turn on the lights on the plate and change 
the frequency of turning on with pwm. I
n job 2, I use the accelerometer, the lcd display and I take advantage of the energy saving mode, to detect falls 
of the plate and go from energy saving mode to active mode. 
In work 3, I develop a communication system using the RS485 communication protocol to establish communication between boards.
The color measurement, This development will use the arduino platform and an RGB sensor to measure colors and process the measurement 
information with the logic of a reversible universal counter.
